# servicebinding-runtime

## Description
Experimental implementation of the [ServiceBinding.io](https://servicebinding.io) [1.0 spec](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/) using [reconciler-runtime](https://github.com/vmware-labs/reconciler-runtime/). The full specification is implemented, please open an issue for any discrepancies.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Define where to publish images:

```sh
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=<a-repository-you-can-write-to>
```

For kind, a registry is not required:

```sh
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=kind.local/servicebinding
```
	
1. Build and Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make deploy
```

### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### Test It Out

1. Run the unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
