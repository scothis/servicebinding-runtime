# Service Binding Runtime <!-- omit in toc -->

Experimental implementation of the [ServiceBinding.io](https://servicebinding.io) [1.0 spec](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/) using [reconciler-runtime](https://github.com/vmware-labs/reconciler-runtime/). The full specification is implemented, please open an issue for any discrepancies.

## Architecture

The [Service Binding for Kubernetes Specification](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/) defines the shape of [Provisioned Services](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#provisioned-service), and how the `Secret` is [projected into a workload](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#workload-projection). The spec says less (intentionally) about how this happens.

Both a controller and mutating admission webhook are used to project a `Secret` defined by the service referenced by the `ServiceBinding` resource into the workloads referenced. The controller is used to process `ServiceBinding`s by resolving services, projecting workloads and updating the status. The webhook is used to prevent removal of the workload projection, projecting workload on create, and a notification trigger for `ServiceBinding`s the controller should process.

The apis, resolver and projector packages are defined by the reference implementation and reused here with slight modifications. The bulk of the work to bind a service to a workload is encapsulated with these packages. The output from the projector is deterministic and idempotent. The order that service bindings are applied to, or removed from, a workload does not matter. If a workload is bound and then unbound, the only trace will be the `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable.

There are a limited number of resources that maintain an informer cache within the manager:
- `ServiceBinding`
- `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping`
- `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`
- `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`

### Controller

When a `ServiceBinding` is created, updated or deleted the controller processes the resource. It will:
- resolve the referenced service resource, looking at it's `.spec.binding.name` for the name of the Secret to bind
- reflect the discovered `Secret` name onto the `ServiceBinding`'s `.status.binding.name`
- the `ServiceAvailable` condition is updated on the `ServiceBinding`
- the references workloads are resolved (either by name or selector)
- a `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` is resolved for the apiVersion/kind of the workload (or a default value for a PodSpecable workload is used)
- the resolved `Secret` name is projected into the workload
- the `Ready` condition is updated on the `ServiceBinding`

### Webhooks

In addition to that main flow, a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` and `ValidationWebhookConfiguration` are updated:
- all `ServiceBinding`s in the cluster are resolved
- the rules for a MutatingWebhookConfiguration are updated based on the set of all workload group-kinds referenced
- the rules for a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration are updated based on the set of all workload and service group-kinds referenced

The `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` is used to intercept create and update requests for workloads:
- all `ServiceBinding`s targeting the workload are resolved
- a `ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping` is resolved for the apiVersion/kind of the workload (or a default value for a PodSpecable workload is used)
- for each `ServiceBinding` the resolved `Secret` name is projected into the workload
- the delta between the original resource and the projected resource is returned with the webhook response as a patch

The `ValidationWebhookConfiguration` is used as an alternative to watching the API Server directly for these types and keeping an informer cache. When a webhook request is received, the `ServiceBinding`s that reference that resource as a workload or service are resolved and enqueued for the controller to process.

No blocking work is performed within the webhooks.

## Supported Services

Kubernetes defines no provisioned services by default, however, `Secret`s may be [directly referenced](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#direct-secret-reference).

Additional services can be supported dynamically by [defining a `ClusterRole`](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#considerations-for-role-based-access-control-rbac).

## Supported Workloads

Support for the built-in k8s workload resource is pre-configured including:
- apps `DaemonSet`
- apps `Deployment`
- apps `ReplicaSet`
- apps `StatefulSet`
- batch `CronJob` (also includes a `ClusterResourceMapping`)
- batch `Job` (since Jobs are immutable, the ServiceBinding must be defined and service resolved before the job is created)
- core `ReplicationController`

Additional workloads can be supported dynamically by [defining a `ClusterRole`](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#considerations-for-role-based-access-control-rbac-1) and if not PodSpecable, a [`ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping`](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/#workload-resource-mapping).


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Define where to publish images:

   ```sh
   export KO_DOCKER_REPO=<a-repository-you-can-write-to>
   ```

   For kind, a registry is not required:

   ```sh
   export KO_DOCKER_REPO=kind.local/servicebinding
   ```
	
1. Build and Deploy the controller to the cluster:

   ```sh
   make deploy
   ```

### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### Test It Out

Run the unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)
